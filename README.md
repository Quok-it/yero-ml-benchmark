  A training and inference benchmarking tool for machine learning.

## Why Is This Needed?

Relatability and reproducibility should be at the forefront of any benchmark. 
<br>
<br>
Current online benchmarks comparing different GPUs in the machine learning space either show inference throughput or a vague point system describing their score.
That alone is not enough for the average person who is more familiar with machine learning as a whole. 
A few of those benchmarks are reproducible with the code they provide (even if it is more obtuse to use) while others are not with only hints of what was used. 
<br>
<br>
This benchmark aims to <b>relate</b> with others who understands the basics that goes into machine learning: the <b>training</b>, the <b>inference</b>, the type of <b>model</b>, and <b>hardware</b> used; 
while maintaining <b>reproducibility</b> of performance regardless of different systems.

## Current Support
* Linux Only
* NVIDIA GPUs
* Image Classification models such as ResNet and ViT
